GIT is a free, open-source software distributed version control system (DVCS) designed to manage all source code history. It can keep a history of commits, can reverse changes, and lets developers share code

GIT HUB, on the other hand, is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It offers all of Gitâ€™s DVCS SCM and has some additional features. This includes collaboration functionality like project management, support ticket management, and bug tracking
